# 🤖 Human-like Browser Automation with Selenium

Automate web browsing in a **natural, human-like manner** using Selenium WebDriver with Microsoft Edge. This script simulates realistic user behavior including typing with mistakes, scrolling, mouse movements, and random interactions to emulate genuine organic browsing and evade automation detection.



## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Natural typing:** Includes random pauses and typos for authenticity  
- 📜 **Human-like scrolling:** Scrolls up, down, and pauses at random intervals  
- 🖱️ **Mouse movement simulation:** Mimics real cursor movements and reading behavior  
- 🔄 **Random page interactions:** Opens/closes tabs, clicks links randomly  
- 🛡️ **Anti-detection techniques:** Reduces automation fingerprint with custom browser settings  
- 🔁 **Multi-search support:** Runs multiple randomized search queries with delays

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Microsoft Edge Browser  
- Compatible Edge WebDriver ([download here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/))

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download and place Edge WebDriver; update `EDGEDRIVERPATH` in the script.  
2. (Optional) Configure your API keys for random query generation.  
3. Run the automation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧩 How It Works

- Launches Microsoft Edge with stealth options to avoid bot detection  
- Generates random search keywords
